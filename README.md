## Dice betting task assignment

Prerequisites :

- NodeJS v16.10.0 +

Setup process :

- Clone the repository
- Once inside, run `npm install` in order to install all dependencies
- Run `npm start` to run the BE part of the dice betting assingment

### Testing

Due to limited time, I am unsure if I will manage to write detailed tests with decent mocks.
Either way, since we are using DI for our repositories, it will be easy to introduce mocks and write tests without actually manipulating any real data.

That way we can actually write our unit and integration tests fairly fast and ensure that our future changes do not break our current features.
